    "This code demonstrates how to build an **inverted index** with positional information and perform **phrase queries** on a collection of documents. Below is a detailed explanation of the code:\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1. Building an Inverted Index with Positions**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def build_inverted_index_with_positions(docs):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Builds an inverted index mapping each term to a dict of:\n",
    "      doc_id → sorted list of positions where the term occurs.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    index = {}\n",

    "#### **What is an Inverted Index?**\n",
    "An **inverted index** is a data structure that maps terms (words) to the documents in which they appear. In this implementation:\n",
    "- Each term is mapped to a dictionary where:\n",
    "  - **Key**: `doc_id` (the document ID where the term appears).\n",
    "  - **Value**: A sorted list of positions where the term occurs in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How It Works:**\n",
    "1. **Input**: A list of documents (`docs`), where each document is a string.\n",
    "2. **Processing**:\n",
    "   - Iterate over each document (`doc_id`) and split its text into words.\n",
    "   - Convert each word to lowercase (`token`) to ensure case-insensitivity.\n",
    "   - Use `setdefault` to:\n",
    "     - Add the term to the index if it doesn't already exist.\n",
    "     - Add the document ID to the term's posting list if it doesn't already exist.\n",
    "   - Append the position of the term in the document to the posting list.\n",
    "3. **Output**: A dictionary representing the inverted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Output:**\n",
    "For the documents:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "docs = [\n",
    "    \"Data science is fun\",\n",
    "    \"Machine learning makes data science powerful\",\n",
    "    \"Science requires data and learning.\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The inverted index will look like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'data': {0: [0], 1: [4], 2: [2]},\n",
    "    'science': {0: [1], 1: [5], 2: [0]},\n",
    "    'is': {0: [2]},\n",
    "    'fun': {0: [3]},\n",
    "    'machine': {1: [0]},\n",
    "    'learning': {1: [1], 2: [4]},\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is a Phrase Query?**\n",
    "A **phrase query** searches for an exact sequence of words (a phrase) in the documents. For example, the phrase `\"data science\"` should match documents where the words \"data\" and \"science\" appear consecutively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How It Works:**\n",
    "1. **Input**:\n",
    "   - `index`: The inverted index built earlier.\n",
    "   - `phrase`: The phrase to search for (e.g., `\"data science\"`).\n",
    "   - `docs`: The list of original documents (used for reference).\n",
    "2. **Processing**:\n",
    "   - Split the phrase into individual terms and convert them to lowercase.\n",
    "   - Start with the posting list of the first term in the phrase.\n",
    "   - Narrow down the candidate documents by intersecting the posting lists of all terms in the phrase.\n",
    "   - For each candidate document:\n",
    "     - Check if the terms appear consecutively at the correct positions.\n",
    "     - If they do, add the document ID to the results.\n",
    "3. **Output**: A sorted list of document IDs where the phrase appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Query:**\n",
    "For the phrase `\"data science\"`:\n",
    "- The terms `\"data\"` and `\"science\"` must appear consecutively in the same document.\n",
    "- The result will be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means the phrase appears in documents 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Example Usage**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "docs = [\n",
    "    \"Data science is fun\",\n",
    "    \"Machine learning makes data science powerful\",\n",
    "    \"Science requires data and learning.\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "idx = build_inverted_index_with_positions(docs)\n",
    "print(phrase_query(idx, \"data science\", docs))  # → [0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. Build the inverted index using `build_inverted_index_with_positions(docs)`.\n",
    "2. Perform a phrase query using `phrase_query(idx, \"data science\", docs)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This indicates that the phrase `\"data science\"` appears in documents 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "1. **Inverted Index**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently maps terms to the documents and positions where they appear.\n",
    "   - Enables fast lookups for terms and their occurrences.\n",
    "2. **Phrase Query**:\n",
    "   - Searches for exact phrases by leveraging the positional information in the inverted index.\n",
    "   - Filters candidate documents and checks for consecutive term positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is a foundational concept in **information retrieval systems**, such as search engines, where efficient text search is critical."
